# BLAST Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simplified version of the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm for local sequence alignment.

## Introduction

BLAST is a widely used bioinformatics tool for comparing biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, or proteins. This simplified Python implementation provides a basic local sequence alignment using a scoring system for matches, mismatches, and gaps.

## Features

- Local sequence alignment.
- Customizable scoring system.
- Provides aligned sequences and alignment score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheScientist01/BlastAlgorithmPython.git
Change directory:

cd blast-algorithm-python

Run the example:

python blast_algorithm.py

**Usage**
To use the BLAST algorithm, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Open the blast_algorithm.py file and modify the seq1 and seq2 variables with your sequences or load them from files.

Customize the scoring system (match, mismatch, and gap penalties) if needed.

Run the script:

python blast_algorithm.py

The script will display the aligned sequences and the alignment score.
